### Hi there, I'm LEON, XIANLIANG LI or YINLEUNG LEY ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ˜„ I am a postgraduate student at [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.ucas.ac.cn/) (UCAS).

ðŸŒ± **My research interests**: I studied astrophysics for my bachelor's degree and worked on target localization and path optimization problems for my master's degree. I am interested in theoretical performance analysis and convergence analysis for machine learning and robotic systems and developing new approaches to optimize deep neural networks and real-world robotic applications.

**Master time**. At SIAT, I work with [Prof. Sheng Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nLsqCz4AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) for **signal processing**. I work with other collaborators for **optimization** and **deep learning**.

ðŸ“« **Contact me by**:
- Email (xl.li4 [AT] siat.ac.cn)
